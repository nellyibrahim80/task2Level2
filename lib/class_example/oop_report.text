Abstract Classes:
Abstract classes are classes  that cannot be instantiated directly. Has no Instant
Static Keyword:

 the static keyword is used to declare members (variables or methods) that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. Static members are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed without creating an instance.
Encapsulation:

 involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class. Access to the internal state of the object is controlled, typically through public and private access modifiers. Encapsulation helps in data hiding and promoting modularity.
Polymorphism:

 the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading, operator overloading) and runtime (method overriding). In Flutter, method overriding is commonly used, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
